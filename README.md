Fraud Detection with imblearn and multiple classification methods


Fraud detection in a large and very imbalanced dataset

Balancing with SMOTE and TomekLinks to compare and select best model 

Best model gets a hyperparameter tuning with a genetic algorithm


TODO:
    Test combined balancing techniques
    Test the genetic algorithm with XGBoost instead of Decision Tree to study its performance
